>>> Your report should include a heading stating your full names, matriculation
numbers and lab groups, and a discussion of your findings for the “interesting” seed
values outlined earlier (i.e., what was the relative performance of the four algorithms,
whether it deviated from your expectations, and what you believe is the cause of the
deviation based on the internal state of the simulator). Feel free to also include any
feedback you may have on the assessed exercise.

When testing our schedulers with the test seeds we were pleased to see that the values we got for our average turnaround time and our average wait times were as exprected.
Some brief feeeedback that I personally have is that this excercise actually helped me visualize the differences and also similarities between schedulers and also the differences between pre-emptive and non pre-emptive scheduling.
