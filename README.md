# NOSE-AE2
Implementation of schedulers and dispatchers for FCFS, SJF, SRTF, RR scheduling algorithms.

This is where we'll write the report.

>>> Your report should include a heading stating your full names, matriculation
numbers and lab groups, and a discussion of your findings for the “interesting” seed
values outlined earlier (i.e., what was the relative performance of the four algorithms,
whether it deviated from your expectations, and what you believe is the cause of the
deviation based on the internal state of the simulator). Feel free to also include any
feedback you may have on the assessed exercise.
